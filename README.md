## Multi-Agent LaserTag Simulation Game

This simulation game runs on the multi-agent simulation framework MARS (Multi-Agent Research and Simulation) to give AI developers an opportunity to implement and test their own AI agents and let them go up against each other to see which one wins. The goal of the game is to collect as many points (by "tagging" enemy agents). The agent with the highest score at the end of the simulation time wins the game. 

For simulation setup, game rules, agent interface, and other information, please see the `Documentation` directory for more details.
