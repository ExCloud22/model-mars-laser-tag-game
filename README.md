## Multi-Agent LaserTag Simulation Game

This simulation game runs on the multi-agent simulation framework MARS (Multi-Agent Research and Simulation) to give AI developers an opportunity to implement and test Ai for agents and let them compete against each other to see which AI wins the game. The goal of the game is to collect as many points as possible (by "tagging" enemy agents). The agent with the highest score at the end of the simulation time wins the game. 

For project and simulation setup, game rules, agent interface, and other information that might be helpful when working with the LaserTag framework, please see the `Documentation` directory.
