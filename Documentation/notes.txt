1) model "stance" as enumeration (more legible in source code)
  - make changes in diagram accordingly (add Enum classifier)
2) add realistic elements (like "reload" and "current ammo = 0) to restrict player
   abilities and possibility of exploiting method calls (for example, spamming "shoot")
3) include layer in diagram


TODO:
general:
- how to change action_points? (in eine Methode auslagern, um zentrale Stelle zu haben?)
- what type must be kept in enemyList and teamList?

change_stance():
- if currStance already equal to newStance, then consider not deduct points
